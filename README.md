## What is a CRDT?
A Conflict-free Replicated Data Type (CRDT) is a data structure that allows multiple replicas to be updated independently and then merged together in a conflict-free manner. This enables collaboration in asynchronous, real-time, and offline scenarios, where each replica can be updated independently and then merged together when they are synced.

## What is Automerge?
Automerge is an npm library for creating and merging CRDTs. It provides a simple interface for creating and manipulating conflict-free data structures that can be shared across multiple clients. A cool thing about Automerge is it uses WebAssembly to perform it's operations quickly.

## How does this project work?
This project is a simple TODO application that demonstrates the use of CRDTs using Automerge. You can load, save, and merge binary representations of your workspace state. The application is meant to be a starting point for building your own CRDT-enabled applications.

## Key Features
- Load, save, and merge binary representations of your workspace state.
- Asynch collaboration using CRDTs (save TODOs, give them to other people , have them edit, then hand back )

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed. Then, simply clone the repository and run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

Once you have the dependencies installed, you can start the application by running `npm run dev`.
